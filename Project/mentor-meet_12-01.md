- first meet: give overall picture of company
- next few: give an idea of product

1. always try to ask what the end deliverable is (mobile app, web app, etc.)
2. understand what technologies the client expects
    - clients not familiar with our coding levels
3. be aware of the timing of the project
    - never happens that all reqs get fulfilled
    - agree on a set of reqs and complete
    - first few weeks, document reqs in SRS
    - put *only what you want to build in SRS*; nothing extra
    - make sure the client is aware of what you are doing / not doing

- SRS is a running document
- if you want to make some change later, update SRS and get approved by client immediately
- make sure the SRS on gitlab is the most recent version
- always take minutes
- SRS deadline EoM tentatively

- there are two releases R1, R2
- R1 first week of March
    - client, sir not present
- R2 end of course
    - final release
    - very imp
