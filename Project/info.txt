Project title:
Framework to access and Validate sensor data

Description of project:
Due to the increasing number of sensor nodes, a large amount of data is being generated. However, factors such as hardware malfunctions, network failures, or cyber-attacks affect data quality and result in inaccurate data generation. Therefore you need to develop a framework for heterogeneous IoT data sources that provides uniform data quality validation.

Features/Database schemas to be implemented:
emaiol notification,data validation,summary update... etc...

Screens/Algorithms to be implemented:
oneM2M understanding, algorithms for lesser time complexity...

Technology/Skills required:
API understanding, Programming Language preferably python

Challenges we see that will have to be addressed:
understand9ing the data models and nature of the data

First 2 weeks: input gathering and formulating clear requirements

Next 4 weeks: understanding data and design/implementation plan

Next 4 weeks: Prototype implementation

Final 4 weeks: Deployment Testing and Documentation
