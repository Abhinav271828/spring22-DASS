- Smart City Living Lab
    - mini smart campus within IIIT
    - deployed > 100 nodes across campus (energy, water, weather etc.)
    - how to visualise data is critical (face of project)

- https://smartcitylivinglab.iiit.ac.in/home/ (building view)
- average of data over all nodes

- static view unsatisfactory
- want to be able to go into detail of places
    - e.g. each floor

- dashboard sends request for data every 10 minutes
- codebase is ready, go through to understand current implementation
    - some bugs
- ideas: 3D view of buildings, go into buildings etc.
         improve database schema
         improve code

- will give access to repo

- ma'am available on MWF at Living Lab, campus

- used Django, postgre; learn those

- building view is more important
    - various parts (3D model, analytics, etc.)
- while doing this, if you see why loading is slow, fix it
    - don't focus on it
    - suggest: 2 people focus on lag, 2 on building view
